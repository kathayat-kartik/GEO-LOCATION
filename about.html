                <p class="section-text">
                    ZoneLock is a next-generation security system that merges encryption technology with real-time geolocation to redefine data protection. Unlike traditional systems that depend only on passwords or static keys, ZoneLock adds an intelligent location-based layer — meaning your data can only be decrypted from a specific physical area.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Even if someone steals your encrypted file or password, they can't unlock it unless they are physically present within the allowed zone.

                <h2 class="section-title">The Idea Behind ZoneLock</h2>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <p class="section-text">
                    In today's digital era, data is constantly shared, transferred, and stored across multiple devices and platforms — increasing the risk of unauthorized access. Many individuals and organizations need their sensitive information to remain accessible only within a certain place — such as a workplace, campus, or secure facility.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    ZoneLock was built to meet that need. By combining AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with the HTML5 Geolocation API, ZoneLock ensures that your data's safety isn't just based on who you are, but where you are.

                <h2 class="section-title">How ZoneLock Works</h2>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <p class="section-text">
                    ZoneLock functions through a seamless combination of front-end encryption and location verification:

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3 class="feature-title">Encryption Based on Location:</h3>
                    <p class="feature-text">
                        When a user encrypts a message, ZoneLock records the device's latitude and longitude coordinates. These coordinates are mathematically integrated into the encryption key, making the ciphertext unique to that location.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3 class="feature-title">Secure Local Storage:</h3>
                    <p class="feature-text">
                        The encrypted message is automatically downloaded as a .encrypted file, ensuring it remains with the user and never leaves the browser.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="feature-card">
                    <h3 class="feature-title">Decryption Within the Zone:</h3>
                    <p class="feature-text">
                        When attempting to decrypt, ZoneLock checks the user's current location. If it matches the original location within a set radius (e.g., 30 meters), the decryption key is validated and the message is revealed. If not — decryption fails.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p class="feature-text">
                        All encryption and decryption occur locally in the browser using JavaScript — no data is uploaded or stored on any external server.
